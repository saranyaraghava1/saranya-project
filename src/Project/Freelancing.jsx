          <b>What is Freelancing?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          A freelancer is a self-employed individual who offers their services
          to clients on a project basis, rather than being permanently employed
          by a single company. Freelancers are often skilled professionals in
          various fields, such as writing, design, programming, or marketing.
          They have the flexibility to choose their projects, set their own
          schedules, and work from any location. Freelancing allows individuals
          to pursue a diverse range of projects, collaborate with different
          clients, and build a portfolio of work. It offers autonomy and the
          opportunity to balance work and lifestyle, making it a popular choice
          for those seeking flexibility and independence in their careers.
